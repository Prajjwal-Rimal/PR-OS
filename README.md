# PR-OS
A x86 Operating System based on existing kernel analysis

## Aim
The aim of the project is to conduct research upon existing operating system kernels based on Assembly, C, and Rust and then implement a minimal bootloader, kernel and a userspace to create a minimal x86 32 bit operating system based on the strengths of the researched kernels and languages. 

## Objective
- Evaluate existing kernels in Assembly, C, and Rust
- Gather and understand the strengths of each language and determine their capabilities
- Implement a minimal x86 32 bit bootloader, kernel, and userspace based on the strengths of the languages
- Find methods to integrate Assembly, C, and Rust together
- Evaluate the project based on criteria mentioned in the evaluation section
- Display the concepts of OS development and system programming 
- Understand proper OS design process and practices
- Explain concepts of memory safety 
- Understand the role of Assembly, C, and Rust in OS development and system programming 
- Try to explain the modern choices in OS development
