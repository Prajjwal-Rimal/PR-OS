Officially **_received the approval_** for the project along with the allocation of supervisor, marking the beginning of the project.

Created a GitHub repository containing the **_README_** file which contains the projects name, description, aim, and objective; a **_changelog_** to track the changes in the repository; and started logging the week1 **_journal_** entry.
