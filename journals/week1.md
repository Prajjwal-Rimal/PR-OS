# Week 1

**Date: 4 Feb 2026**

Officially **_received the approval_** for the project along with the allocation of supervisor, marking the beginning of the project.

Created a GitHub repository containing the **_README_** file which contains the projects name, description, aim, and objective; a **_changelog_** to track the changes in the repository; and started logging the week1 **_journal_** entry. 

Started research by reading past papers, journals, and other sources for the **literature review** and also to support the **design choices** for the project

Had **_conversation with professors and with industry professional_** about the project specification, to better understand and align the scope and the measurable of the project. 

During the meeting agreed on the following details

 1. **_Bootloader_** should be **BIOS** based, rather than UEFI based to avoid additional complexity, for the size of the project a minimal BIOS Bootloader fits the architecture best

2. The **_kernel_** is to have a **monolithic design** as it easier to design and implement, and has faster execution speeds.

3. The **_license_** of the project will be based on the **_GPL V2.0_**, as it is a **strong copyleft** license, **everyone understand** it, it is **widely accepted**, and it is considered as the **very good standard**; **GPL v3.0** has more **protections**. 

4. The **_measurable_** of the OS should highlight the **stability** of the OS as well **the journey it took to build the OS:** lines of safe code, lines of unsafe code, runtime, challenges faced during development, and the learning curve.

5. **_Userspace_** must be able to run one **simple program** if implementing a **Unix like command it itself is a program**.

6. Find the **_best way to implement all 3 languages_** (Assembly, C, Rust) is the OS to **highlight the strengths** of each language for system programming and OS development.

7. **_Further research and reading_** on **previous papers and projects** is needed before the commencement of the project.

8. Keep the **_documentation_** **precise and necessary**.

Finished **_research_** and deepened **_understanding_** on **bootloader, BIOS, UEFI, and the boot process**. Further **papers** were **identified** to conduct **research on kernel design and architecture**, along with the **strengths of Assembly, C, and Rust** programming languages.

**_Deployed documentation_** on **GitHub pages** to make the documentation as interactive as possible. **Changes** are also **self managed** and **reflected** with every push.
